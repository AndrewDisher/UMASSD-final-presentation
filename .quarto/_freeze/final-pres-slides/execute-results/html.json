Tolkien was a philologist, a practitioner of etymology as it relates to texts. \n  - He knew where words came from and how their usage had changed over time.\n  - This shows in his expert usage of words in his writing. \n\n. . . \n\n* An example:\n  - > \"Lathspell I name you, Ill-news. And ill news is an ill guest they say.\"\n    >\n    >    <cite> Grima's address to Gandalf <br> </cite>\n    >    <cite> The Two Towers, Book 3, Chapter 6 <br> </cite>\n    >    <cite> The king of the Golden Hall </cite>\n    \n. . .\n    \n* The word `lathspell` comes from Old English, and it's meaning is the exact opposite of the much more common word `gospel`, good-news. \n* This is one of the more well known examples, but their are many. \n\n## What are Simplicial Complexes?\n\n> In mathematics, a `simplicial complex` is a set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts.\n\n. . .\n\n* They are a type of higher order network.\n  - Instead of simple pairwise connections (links), they describe three-way interactions, four-way, etc.\n  - Simplicial complexes allow for the use of combinatorics and algebraic topology to study higher order graphs more easily. \n\n. . .\n\n* They are composed of `simplices`\n  - A `point` (*0*-simplex), \n  - A `line` (*1*-simplex),\n  - A `triangle` (*2*-simplex),\n  - A `tetrahedron` (*3*-simplex),\n  - and generalized into *n*-dimensions. \n  \n![](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/1248976/fncom-17-1248976-HTML/image_m/fncom-17-1248976-g002.jpg){.absolute top=580 left=950 width=\"850\"}\n\n## Ok COOL... So how do the two fit together?\n\n![](https://www.askwoody.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gollum.jpg){.absolute top=200 left=460 width=\"1000\"}\n\n## Our Simplicial Complex\n\n. . .\n\n* Imagine...\n  - our network's `nodes` are languages,\n  - our `links` connect two languages that share an influence on an English word\n  - and our `triangles` connect three languages, \n  - and so on.\n\n. . .\n\n* This produces a structure that:\n  - describes which languages have influenced the etymologies of English words,\n  - which pairs, triads, etc. have `together` influenced English words,\n  - and how many words they have influenced. \n  \n\n## What does this data look like?\n\n. . . \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nnodes <- read.csv(\"data/simplex-data-1.csv\")\nlinks <- read.csv(\"data/simplex-data-2.csv\")\ntriangles <- read.csv(\"data/simplex-data-3.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n. . . \n\n* Nodes\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnodes %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Lang_1 Weighted_Word_Count\n1 Akkadian                  13\n2 Albanian                 105\n3   Arabic                 340\n4  Aramaic                 137\n5   Arawak                   2\n6 Armenian                2670\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n. . .\n\n* Links\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlinks %>% \n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Lang_1      Lang_2 Weighted_Word_Count\n1 Akkadian      Arabic                   9\n2 Akkadian      French                   4\n3 Akkadian       Greek                   4\n4 Akkadian      Hebrew                   9\n5 Akkadian       Latin                   4\n6 Akkadian Old English                   4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## What does this data look like?

Etymolgies generate a lot of data.\n\n::: aside\nNotes: Counts are weighted by token appearance of words in text.\n:::\n\n## Visualizing the Data\n\n* Simplicial complexes of text data are\n  - High dimensional (refer to the cat example)\n  - hard to visualize\n\n* It is more useful to view only the first three dimensions of a complex. \n* This would produce a network with nodes, links, and triangles. \n\n. . .\n\nUnfortunately, there are very few tools available to visualize higher order network data like this.\n\nSo, a custom-built visualization of this data was created using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and a great JS library called [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph).\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n<a href=\"https://andrewdisher.github.io/lotr-threejs-etymology-graph/\">![](three-network.png){height=500}</a>\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n`Click the image to view the visualization!`\n\n* You can \n  - zoom in/out, \n  - travel to a node by clicking on it, \n  - and hover on a node to hide any others not connected to it.\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Simplicial Complexes in Text\n\nSimplicial complexes found in text have some interesting properties. \n\n. . .\n\n* They are large. \n  - LOTR had ~5,000 unique words (for which we had etymologies). \n  - These words came from about 120 identifiable languages.\n  - Some words had only 1 or 2 language influences, some (like cat) had almost 30!\n  - My 16GiB RAM computer could not store all the simplex subsets generated from words with more than 22 languages influences. \n  \n. . .\n\n* They tend to share similar Euler Characteristic (measure of size)\n  - Although hardware limitations prevented calculating this for the LOTR data, similar complexes from smaller texts, such as Bertrand Russel's *\"The Place of Science in a Liberal Education\"* and others, produced Euler characteristics of 2. This is the same as any convex polyhedron. \n  \n## Further Applications\n\n* Simplicial complexes arise in neuroscience, study of biological networks, etc. \n* Studying text with them yields interesting results\n  - `Shorter` text, `smaller` complex. `Increasing` length, `diminishing returns` (complexes don't get TOO much bigger)\n\n. . .\n\n* Simplicial complexes in text also *grow* as the text progresses. \n  - Further research into how fast a simplicial complex grows from new words with new etymological roots would be insightful. \n  - This is a dynamic simplicial complex.\n  \n. . .\n\n* Studying various authors and their works, and comparing to Tolkien's work.\n  - Are etymological roots different?\n  - Are they as varied?\n  - The English language has many words that derive from Latin, but we commonly use words derived from Germanic sources more often.\n    - Are there any authors for which this is not the case?\n    \n## A Dream\n\n* What if we created...\n  - A comprehensive higher-order network for the entire English language?\n  - This would require an exhaustive list of English words and etymologies.\n  - What about for all language?!\n  \n. . .\n  \nThis would be a valid way of documenting the history of human language, which we could continuously update with time. \n\nBut...\n\n. . . \n\nThis is an impossible feat sadly, albeit one that deserves imagining!\n\n## Data Reference\n\n* Etymologies for many English words were found at [Etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/)\n* Comprehensive list of languages scraped from [One World Nations Online](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/language_code.htm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
