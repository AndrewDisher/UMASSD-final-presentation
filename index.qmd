## What are Etymologies?

> `Etymology` is the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history. 

. . .

* An `etymology` is found by tracing its development since its earliest recorded occurrence in the language where it is found.
  - It is NOT a definition; it's more like a record of all previous definitions for the word. 
  - Words' spelling, pronunciation, and usages can all change over time.
  - Cultures who speak a language can see their language change over time, or languages can adopt words from others. 
 
. . .

Tracing a word's etymology gives us a glimpse of how the word was shaped and used by speakers, and are important
to our understanding of how different cultures and languages influenced the word. 

## The Discipline of Etymology Today

. . .

* Etymology is a discipline in decline, and unfortunately little importance is placed on understanding where our own words come from. 

. . .

* J.R.R. Tolkien was a philologist, a practitioner of etymology as it relates to texts. 
  - He knew where words came from and how their usage had changed over time.
  - This shows in his expert usage of words in his writing. 

. . . 

* An example:
  - > "Lathspell I name you, Ill-news. And ill news is an ill guest they say."
    >
    >    <cite> Grima's address to Gandalf <br> </cite>
    >    <cite> The Two Towers, Book 3, Chapter 6 <br> </cite>
    >    <cite> The king of the Golden Hall </cite>
    
. . .
    
* The word `lathspell` comes from Old English, and its meaning is the exact opposite of the much more common word `gospel`, good-news. 
* This is one of the more well known examples, but there are many. 

## What are Simplicial Complexes?

> In mathematics, a `simplicial complex` is a set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts.

. . .

* They are a type of higher order network.
  - Instead of simple pairwise connections (links), they describe three-way interactions, four-way, etc.
  - Simplicial complexes allow for the use of combinatorics and algebraic topology to study higher order graphs more easily. 

. . .

* They are composed of `simplices`
  - A `point` (*0*-simplex), 
  - A `line` (*1*-simplex),
  - A `triangle` (*2*-simplex),
  - A `tetrahedron` (*3*-simplex),
  - and generalized into *n*-dimensions.

## Ok COOL... So how do the two fit together?

## Our Simplicial Complex

. . .

* Imagine...
  - our network's `nodes` are languages,
  - our `links` connect two languages that share an influence on an English word
  - and our `triangles` connect three languages, 
  - and so on.

. . .

* This produces a structure that:
  - describes which languages have influenced the etymologies of English words,
  - which pairs, triads, etc. have `together` influenced English words,
  - and how many words they have influenced. 
  

## What does this data look like?

. . . 

```{r}
library(dplyr)

nodes <- read.csv("data/simplex-data-1.csv")
links <- read.csv("data/simplex-data-2.csv")
triangles <- read.csv("data/simplex-data-3.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(nodes) <- c("Lang_1", "Weighted_Word_Count")
colnames(links) <- c("Lang_1", "Lang_2", "Weighted_Word_Count")
colnames(triangles) <- c("Lang_1", "Lang_2", "Lang_3", "Weighted_Word_Count")
```

. . . 

* Nodes

```{r}
nodes %>% 
  head()
```

. . .

* Links


```{r}
links %>% 
  head()
```

## What does this data look like? (cont.)

* Triangles

```{r}
triangles %>% 
  head()
```

. . .

The word `cat` is influenced by `29` languages! Some combinatorics show us the number of simplex subsets this generates.

. . .

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(scipen=999)
```

```{r}
num_simplices <- 0
n <- 29

for (k in (n - 1):1) {
  num_simplices <- num_simplices + choose(n, k)
}

num_simplices %>% 
  format(big.mark = ",")
```

That's a LOT. Etymolgies generate a lot of data.

::: aside
Notes: Counts are weighted by token appearance of words in text.

## Visualizing the Data

* Simplicial complexes of text data are
  - High dimensional (refer to the cat example)
  - hard to visualize

* It is more useful to view only the first three dimensions of a complex. 
* This would produce a network with nodes, links, and triangles. 

. . .

Unfortunately, there are very few tools available to visualize higher order network data like this.

So, a custom-built visualization of this data was created using [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and a great JS library called [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph).

* You can 
  - zoom in/out, 
  - travel to a node by clicking on it, 
  - and hover on a node to hide any others not connected to it.

## Simplicial Complexes in Text

Simplicial complexes found in text have some interesting properties. 

. . .

* They are large. 
  - LOTR had ~5,000 unique words (for which we had etymologies). 
  - These words came from about 120 identifiable languages.
  - Some words had only 1 or 2 language influences, some (like cat) had almost 30!
  - My 16GiB RAM computer could not store all the simplex subsets generated from words with more than 22 languages influences. 
  
. . .

* They tend to share similar Euler Characteristic (measure of size)
  - Although hardware limitations prevented calculating this for the LOTR data, similar complexes from smaller texts, such as Bertrand Russel's *"The Place of Science in a Liberal Education"* and others, produced Euler characteristics of 2. This is the same as any convex polyhedron. 
  
## Further Applications

* Simplicial complexes arise in neuroscience, study of biological networks, etc. 
* Studying text with them yields interesting results
  - `Shorter` text, `smaller` complex. `Increasing` length, `diminishing returns` (complexes don't get TOO much bigger)

. . .

* Simplicial complexes in text also *grow* as the text progresses. 
  - Further research into how fast a simplicial complex grows from new words with new etymological roots would be insightful. 
  - This is a dynamic simplicial complex.
  
. . .

* Studying various authors and their works, and comparing to Tolkien's work.
  - Are etymological roots different?
  - Are they as varied?
  - The English language has many words that derive from Latin, but we commonly use words derived from Germanic sources more often.
    - Are there any authors for which this is not the case?
    
## A Dream

* What if we created...
  - A comprehensive higher-order network for the entire English language?
  - This would require an exhaustive list of English words and etymologies.
  - What about for all language?!
  
. . .
  
This would be a valid way of documenting the history of human language, which we could continuously update with time. 

But...

. . . 

This is an impossible feat sadly, albeit one that deserves imagining!
